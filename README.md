Pronouns: He/Him<br>
I'm a (almost) junior in High School with an interest in a Computer Science (or related) major and an aerospace minor, though I am interested in game development as well. I focus most of my time on learning C++ and coding structures. My pinned repos are my most confident. <br><br>
