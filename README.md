Pronouns: Any

I'm a junior in High School with an interest in a Computer Science (or related) major and an aerospace minor, though I am interested in game development as well. A significant majority of my time is spent in Python, now-a-days in Deep-Learning related projects like [VikX](https://github.com/VikramC-457/VikX) and [StarryRight](https://github.com/MaxAdams0/StarryRight). I am a part of the Alpha Knights FRC Robotics Team, in whcih I am the the Supply Chain Manager (I manage funds and order materials/tools/parts) by title, though I spend most of my time as a Software team member.
