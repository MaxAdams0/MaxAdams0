Pronouns: He/Him<br>
I'm mostly interested in back-end design, specifically within the aerospace and gaming industries. Some of my more important projects are on this github but many are lost to time. I am a high school softmore.<br>
Currently I am learning the Unity game engine, aiding in programming components of Alpha Knight's 2023 Robot, and creating a software guide robot for the same team. <br>
