Pronouns: Any

I'm a junior in High School with an interest in a Computer Science (or related) major and an aerospace minor, though I am interested in game development as well. A significant majority of my time is spent in C++ and Python, depending on the project. I am a part of the Alpha Knights FRC Robotics Team as a part of the Software team (obviously), and am currently working as the Logistics role (handling part purchase requests and purchases). I am still trying to find a way to automate this task so I can be used elsewhere (and not have to manage spreadsheets when I could be doing what I enjoy lol please).
