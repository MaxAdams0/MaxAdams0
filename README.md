Pronouns: Any

I'm a junior in high school majorly focused on game, aerospace, and low-level programming. I've recently commited myself into working on my graphics and game engine OpenGoodLuck (a play on the name OpenGL becuase of the difficulty if you are not humerously inclined), which I hope to develop into something... I guess. I mostly work in C++ and Python, but I've also dabbled in Go, JS, Java, and plan on trying out PHP sometime too. I'm not particularly fond of networking, but I've grown interested in systems like databases as of recent.
